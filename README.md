# ML Model Deployment in Heroku
## A Random Classifier Model is built for the Fish Dataset to predict the type of fish based on features weight, length, height and width
## Then the model is deployed in a local host through Flask after creating a front end web page that has all the features and the button for prediction
## Also it is then hosted in Heroku by connecting with the GitHub Repo created for the corresponding model
